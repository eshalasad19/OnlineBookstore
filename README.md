# Online Bookstore SQL Project

This project simulates a simple **Online Bookstore Database System**.  
It includes database creation, table design, data import, and various SQL queries — from basic to advanced — to analyze sales, customers, and inventory.

## 📘 Project Overview
The goal is to design and query a database that manages books, customers, and their orders efficiently.  
It helps practice essential SQL concepts like joins, grouping, aggregate functions, and filtering.

**Tables:**
- **Books:** Stores details like title, author, genre, published year, price, and stock.
- **Customers:** Holds customer information including name, contact, and location.

## 🧠 Key SQL Features Used
- `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`
- `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` relationships  
- `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`
- `COALESCE`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` functions
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `BETWEEN`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
2. Copy the SQL code from `PROJECT.sql`  
3. Run it step-by-step to create and query the database  
4. Modify the queries to experiment with your own data
